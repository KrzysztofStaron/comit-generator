# Stream Error Fixes

## Problem

The comic generation stream was encountering `TypeError: Invalid state: Controller is already closed` errors when the client disconnected or when there were network issues during generation.

## Root Cause

- The stream controller was being closed prematurely
- No proper handling for client disconnections
- Missing error handling for controller state

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Server-Side Fixes (`generate-comic-stream/route.ts`)

**Controller State Management:**

```typescript
let isClosed = false;

const sendEvent = (event: string, data: any) => {
  if (isClosed) {
    console.log("Attempted to send event to closed stream:", event);
    return;
  }

  try {
    const message = `event: ${event}\ndata: ${JSON.stringify(data)}\n\n`;
    controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(message));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error sending event:", error);
    isClosed = true;
  }
};
```

**Safe Controller Closing:**

```typescript
const closeController = () => {
  if (!isClosed) {
    isClosed = true;
    try {
      controller.close();
    } catch (error) {
      console.log("Controller already closed");
    }
  }
};
```

**Improved Error Handling:**

- Check if controller is closed before sending events
- Graceful error handling in finally block
- Prevent multiple close attempts

### 2. Client-Side Fixes (`ComicGenerator.tsx`)

**Abort Controller Integration:**

```typescript
const controller = new AbortController();
setAbortController(controller);

const response = await fetch("/api/generate-comic-stream", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ prompt, gridSize, artStyle, tone }),
  signal: controller.signal, // Enable cancellation
});
```

**Stream Reader Safety:**

```typescript
try {
  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read();
    if (done) break;
    // ... processing
  }
} catch (streamError) {
  console.error("Stream reading error:", streamError);
} finally {
  try {
    reader.releaseLock();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Reader already released");
  }
}
```

**Cancellation Support:**

- Added cancel button during generation
- Abort controller for clean cancellation
- Proper cleanup of resources

### 3. User Experience Improvements

**Cancel Button:**

- Red X button appears during generation
- Instantly stops the generation process
- Shows appropriate toast message

**Better Error Messages:**

- Distinguishes between cancellation and errors
- More informative error handling
- Graceful degradation

**Enhanced Input Handling:**

- Prevents Enter key during generation
- Disabled state management
- Visual feedback improvements

## Benefits

1. **Robust Error Handling**: No more stream controller errors
2. **User Control**: Users can cancel long-running generations
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
4. **Better UX**: Clear feedback and error messages
5. **Network Resilience**: Handles disconnections gracefully

## Testing Scenarios Covered

- ✅ Normal generation flow
- ✅ User cancellation mid-generation
- ✅ Network disconnection during generation
- ✅ Server errors during panel generation
- ✅ Client refresh during generation
- ✅ Multiple rapid generation attempts
