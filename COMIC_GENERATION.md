# AI Comic Generator - Hybrid Generation System

## Overview

This comic generator uses a sophisticated hybrid approach to ensure character consistency across comic panels:

### ðŸŽ¯ **Generation Strategy**

1. **First Panel**: Generated using **DALL-E 3**

   - Creates high-quality initial panel with detailed character descriptions
   - Establishes the visual style and character appearance

2. **Subsequent Panels**: Generated using **Replicate Flux (flux-kontext-max)**
   - Uses the previous panel as context for character consistency
   - Maintains exact same character appearance, clothing, and features
   - Each panel builds upon the previous one for perfect continuity

### ðŸ”§ **Required Environment Variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with:

```env
# OpenAI API Key - Required for comic generation and first panel creation
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Replicate API Token - Required for character-consistent panel generation using Flux
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token_here
```

### ðŸš€ **How It Works**

1. **Character Design**: GPT-4o-mini creates detailed character descriptions
2. **Story Generation**: Complete narrative story is created first
3. **Panel Breakdown**: Story is divided into individual panel descriptions
4. **Real-time Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream progress to client
5. **Progressive Display**: Grid shows skeleton panels that fill with real images
6. **Hybrid Image Generation**:
   - Panel 1: DALL-E 3 generates the base panel
   - Panel 2-N: Flux uses previous panel + new prompt for consistency

### ðŸ’¡ **Benefits**

- **Real-time Progress**: See panels generate one by one in real-time
- **Perfect Character Consistency**: Each panel references the previous one
- **High-Quality Output**: DALL-E 3 quality for initial panel
- **Style Maintenance**: Flux maintains visual style throughout
- **Progressive UI**: Visual feedback with skeleton â†’ loading â†’ complete states
- **Fallback System**: DALL-E 3 fallback if Flux fails

### ðŸŽ¨ **Supported Features**

- Multiple grid layouts (1x1 to 4x1)
- 8 different art styles (cartoon, manga, superhero, etc.)
- 8 different tones (funny, dramatic, etc.)
- Character consistency across all panels
- Download and gallery functionality

### ðŸ”„ **Generation Flow**

```
User Prompt â†’ Character Design â†’ Story Creation â†’ Panel Breakdown â†’
Panel 1 (DALL-E 3) â†’ Panel 2 (Flux + Panel 1) â†’ Panel 3 (Flux + Panel 2) â†’ ...
```

This ensures that each character maintains their exact appearance, clothing, and features throughout the entire comic story!
